#### Situation

Where are my foodies at? ðŸ˜‹ 

In order to make FoodieX the best delivery service in town, the data science team is focusing its efforts on analyzing the data set to provide useful insights into the business. 

You can find a data set below with restaurant information. The data set contains Restaurant ID, Latitude, Longitude, Cuisines, Average Cost, Minimum Order, Rating, Votes, Reviews, and Cook Time.

#### Your Task

Review the data and draw four conclusions you can find from the data set. Some ideas of conclusions could include: trying to identify the trending restaurants with your own scoring algorithm (can be as simple as the best rating or most votes or both!), clustering restaurant locations to figure out the optimized FoodieX pick up zones, estimating cook time based on restaurant info, and demonstrating your findings using a data visualization tool. As an important member of the FoodieX team, you get to come up with your own analysis! So try your best to dig out any useful information out of this data set. The sky's the limit! ðŸ¤“
